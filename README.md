# Cats vs Dogs Transfer Learning (v1.2)

## 🏢 Business Context

Automated pet image classification has applications in veterinary clinics, animal shelters, and retail services. By accurately distinguishing between cats and dogs, organizations can streamline intake processes, personalize marketing campaigns, and optimize inventory management, reducing manual effort and improving customer satisfaction.

## 🚀 Features and Highlights

* **End‑to‑End Pipeline**: Automated download, extraction, and preprocessing of the Cats vs Dogs dataset.
* **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pretrained MobileNetV2 as a fixed feature extractor to accelerate training.
* **Training & Evaluation**: Conducts model training with real‑time logging; includes accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1‑score.
* **Visualization**: Generates accuracy/loss curves and a confusion matrix for in‑depth performance analysis.
* **Model Export**: Saves the fine‑tuned model (`cats_dogs_mobilenet_v2.h5`) for reuse in inference.
* **Live Demo**: Deployable as a Gradio app on Hugging Face Spaces.

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric    | Value | Business Impact                                         |
| --------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accuracy  | 92.4% | High overall classification reliability                 |
| Precision | 94.1% | Reduces false positives (e.g., labeling a cat as a dog) |
| Recall    | 91.8% | Ensures most dog images are correctly identified        |
| F1‑Score  | 92.9% | Balanced performance across both classes                |

> ![Confusion Matrix](plots/confusion_matrix.png)
> The confusion matrix shows strong separability, with most misclassifications occurring on ambiguous poses or low‑resolution images.

## 🔧 Application (`app.py`)

```python
import gradio as gr
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import os

# Load model from models directory
model_path = os.path.join('models', 'cats_dogs_mobilenet_v2.h5')
model = tf.keras.models.load_model(model_path)

def predict_cat_dog(image):
    if image is None:
        return {str(i): 0.0 for i in range(2)}
    # Convert to grayscale, resize, normalize
    img = Image.fromarray(image).convert('RGB')
    img = img.resize((224, 224))
    arr = np.array(img) / 255.0
    arr = arr.reshape(1, 224, 224, 3)

    pred = float(model.predict(arr)[0][0])
    return {'Cat': 1-pred, 'Dog': pred}

interface = gr.Interface(
    fn=predict_cat_dog,
    inputs=gr.Sketchpad(stroke_width=20, stroke_color='white', background_color='black', height=280, width=280),
    outputs=gr.Label(classes=['Cat', 'Dog']),
